## 3. Defined Approach

The project is designed to create a simple and beginner-friendly banking user interface using basic web technologies.

- HTML is used to structure the web page elements such as balance display, input field, and buttons.
- CSS is used to style the interface, add a background image, center the card layout, and improve visual appearance.
- JavaScript is used to add functionality to the Deposit and Withdraw buttons by updating the balance dynamically based on user input.

The application runs completely on the browser without using any backend or database and is intended for learning basic front-end development concepts.
